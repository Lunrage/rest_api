# rest_api
This code is for a Rest API application that enables saving data to (and retrieving data from) an SQL database and displaying the data onto an HTML page.
The HTML page is styled with CSS, and the data posted by the user or retrieved from the database is processed through the use of JSON, JavaScript, JQuery, and AJAX.

The HTML page in question is for a hypothetical cake design online business.
